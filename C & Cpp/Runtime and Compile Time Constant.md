- **run time constant:** constants whose respective values can only be known or computed at the time of running of source code.
	- run time constants are a bit slower than compile time constants but are more flexible than compile time constants.

- **compile time constants:** constants whose respective value is known or computed at the time of compilation of source code.
	- compile time constants are faster than run-time constants but are less flexible than run-time constants.
