- Software that creates and runs virtual machines by separating a computer software from its hardware 
	- also called a virtual machine monitor 

- **hypervisor type 1:**
	- runs directly on the host's hardware
	- monitors the guest operating system that run on a separate level above the hypervisor 
- **hypervisor type 2:**
	-  runs on a conventional operating system just as other computer programs do
- Type 1 hypervisor will perform better than type 2 hypervisor because a type 1 hypervisor avoids the overhead of the host operating system when accessing physical resources. implementation of type 2 is easier.
