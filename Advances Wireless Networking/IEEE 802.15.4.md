- A technical standard that defines the operation of a low rate [[Wireless PAN]].
	- it specifies he physical layer and the media access control
- The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC specifies two MAC modes
	1. non-beacon-enabled
	2. beacon-enabled
	- the non-beacon enabled MAC is an asychronous carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) MAC, which is very similar to the IEEE 802.11 MAC
	- the beacon-enabled MAC allows two different MAC periods:
	1. a synchronised - CSMA MAC period 
	2. a time slotted, content free MAC period
