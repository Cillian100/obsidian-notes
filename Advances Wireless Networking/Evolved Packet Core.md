- A framework for providing coverage voice and data services on a 4G Long Term Evolution LTE Network 

## Evolved Packet Core Architecture 
1. **Mobility Management Entity:**
	- manages session states and authenticates and tracks users across the network
2. **Serving Gateway (S-GW)**:
	- connects EPC to the LTE radio access network (RAN) and routes IP data packets through the access network to the LTE core network
3. **Packet Data Node Gateway (P-GW):**
	- acts on the interface between the LTE network and other IP networks 
4. **Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF):**
	- supports service data flow detection and helps with policy enforcement and flow-based charging
