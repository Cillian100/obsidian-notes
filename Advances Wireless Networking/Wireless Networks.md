## Intro 
- Wireless networking enables devices to communicate without physical cables, typically using a wireless access network card with a built-int antenna that connects to an access point, which aggregate multiple connections to a wired network point.

#### Types of Wireless Network Connections
- **[[Wireless LAN]]:** a local area network is a computer network that exists at a single site
	- consists of components like switches, access points, routers, firewalls and Ethernet cables
	- Wi-Fi is the most commonly known wireless LAN
- **[[Wireless PAN]]:** a personal-area network consists of a network centralised around the devices of a single person in a single location 
	- bluetooth is the most commonly known wireless PAN 
- **[[Wireless MAN]]:** a metropolitan-are network is a computer network that spans across a small geographic area 
	- a LAN usually consists of a solitary building or area, a MAN can cover several square miles
- **[[Wireless WAN]]:** a wide-area network covers a very large area
	- the internet and cellular services are wireless WANs 

- Mobile computing research has focused on mechanisms for wireless computers to establish ad-hoc networks without infrastructure, with protocols such as [[Ad hoc On-Demand Vector (AODV)]] and [[Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)]] supporting dynamic routing. 

## Wireless Network Architecture and Technologies
- Ad hoc networks such as Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANETs) and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), operate without established infrastructure or centralised control replying on peer-to-peer architecture and dynamic typologies.  
- Wireless Distributed Systems (WDS) are a form of mesh networking, enabling distributed wireless clouds and non-line-of-sight connectivity by forwarding packets between access points, with bandwidth loss occurring over multiple hops. 

## Wireless Communication Protocols, Standards and Mobility Management 
- The [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards underpins wireless networking, with variants such as 802.11b operating in the 2.4-2.483 GHz unlicensed band, using Direct-Sequence Spread Specture (DSSS) and supporting data rates up to 11Mbps over a range of 100 meters.
- Medium access control in IEEE 802.11 networks is governed by mechanisms that coordinate access to the wireless medium, such as use of channel selection and automatic data rate adjustment to minimise interface and maintain connectivity. 

## Emerging Trends, Machine Learning and Future Directions in Wireless Networking
- Machine learning algorithms have been proposed for almost all Open System Interconnection (OSI) layer functions of wireless networks, including adaptive rate and power control, adaptive channel equalisation, modular classification and wireless interface classification at the physical layer.
- Intelligent edge computing, also referred to as edge intelligence, is increasingly important for distributed wireless networks.
- Software-Define Networking (SDN) and network virtualisation are enabling programmability, elastic and heterogeneous wireless infrastructure. SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, enhancing programmability, flexibility and scalability in wireless networks.
