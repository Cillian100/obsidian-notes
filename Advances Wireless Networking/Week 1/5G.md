- 5F planning aims at higher capacity than current 4G, allowing a higher density of mobile broadband users and supporting device-to-device communication, ultra reliable, and massive machine communication.
- 5G development also aims at lower latency than 4G equipment and lower batter consumption for better implementation of the internet-of-things.

- 5G networks divide coverage areas into smaller zones called cells, enabling devices to connect to local base stations via radio. Each station connects to the broader telephone network and the internet through high sped optical fibre or wireless backhaul.
