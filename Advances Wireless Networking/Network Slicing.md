- The separation of multiple virtual networks that operate on the same physical hardware for different applications, services or purpose.
- Network slicing is a way of creating multiple unique logical and visualised networks on top of shared infrastructure using software-defined networking (SDN).
- Applying the same principle of virtualisation to the radio access networks (RANs), a network operator can physically segregate traffic through slices.
