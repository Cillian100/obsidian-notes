- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) is a method used in computer networks to help devices share a communication channel without interfering with each other.
- Before devices sends data, it listens to the channel (or sense the carrier) to check if its free.

## Types of CSMA Protocol 
1. CSMA/CA
2. CSMA/CD

- Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is a network protocol for carrier transmission that operates in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. In contrast to CSMA/CD that deals with collisions after their occurrence, CSMA/CA prevents collisions prior to their occurrence.
