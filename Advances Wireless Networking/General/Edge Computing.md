- Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that enables computation to be conducted at the network edge, allowing data processing and storage to occur closer to the data source.

### Fog Computing
- a decentralised architecture that extends cloud services to the edge of a network, placing compute, storage and networking resources on local devices (fog nodes) like routers or gateways rather than solely in distant data centres. 

## Multiple Access Edge Computing 
- a distributed computing architecture that places computational resources and services closer to the network edge, where data is created and consumed.
- this proximity minimises latency and enhances network efficiency by processing data locally rather than in data centres.
